Cut the Rope Remix

Steven Lei and Jeremy Wong pd. 5

## Running Instructions

Clone or download this repo. Run `main.pde` in the `main` directory in Processing.


## Game objective

Deliver the black ball to Jeremy by cutting sequence of ropes to win.

## Playing Instructions

Use the buttons to navigate to the level screen. Once in a level, the `levels` button returns you to the levels menu and the `retry` button restarts the level. 

Cut the rope by holding down the mouse and sliding across. You can cut multiple ropes at once.

Since it is visually hard to display rope tension, the some ropes have "imaginary" slack and will extend a little bit more than their starting display. It will stop when taut.

Letting the ball go out of the screen (e.g. gravity or from swinging) will result in a defeat. Swinging the ball under Jeremy will not count as a victory. The ball must hit his face directly by gravity or swinging.

You can replay the level or go back after a defeat/victory.
